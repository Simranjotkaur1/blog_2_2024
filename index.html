            <h2>Elon Musk’s Optimus bot stole the show at Tesla’s robo-taxi unveil—but the AI was all smoke and mirrors</h2>

            <p>At Tesla's "We, Robot" event, Elon Musk showcased the humanoid robot Optimus, which impressed attendees by walking and performing tasks. However, it was later revealed that the robots were controlled by humans, not autonomous as implied. This led to criticism over a lack of transparency, though the robot's mechanics were still praised. Musk predicts Optimus will become Tesla's most important product, with huge future sales potential.

            <h2>Women can exercise less often than men and still see greater health benefits, new study shows</h2>
            <img id="imgfood" src="./Screenshot 2024-11-05 at 2.08.12 PM.png" alt="article alt text here">
         
           <p> A recent study found that women may gain more health benefits from exercise than men, even with less time spent on physical activity. Analyzing data from over 400,000 adults, researchers observed that women who did 2.5 hours of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise weekly had a 24% lower risk of death, compared to a 15% reduction for men doing the same. Men required about five hours of weekly exercise for a similar mortality benefit. While reasons for this difference remain unclear, anatomical factors may play a role. Despite study limitations, experts agree that regular exercise is essential for heart health and recommend aerobic and strength-training activities that are enjoyable and sustainable.</p>

            <img id="imgfood" src="./Screenshot 2024-11-13 at 11.07.52 AM.png" alt="article alt text here">
         
           <p>Donald Trump, following a recent election win, is quickly forming his administration with notable figures, including some high-profile and hardline MAGA supporters. Key appointments so far include Fox News host Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as Secretary of Homeland Security, and entrepreneur Elon Musk in an advisory role. Trump is also considering potential cabinet picks like Mike Waltz and Marco Rubio, signaling a commitment to policies aligned with his conservative base. This administration is expected to emphasize stricter immigration policies and potentially shift U.S. foreign and environmental strategies.</p>
